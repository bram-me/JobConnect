### Bridging the Skills Gap in Africa‚Äôs Job Market

---

## Overview

**JobConnect** is a platform designed to bridge the skills gap between young African job seekers and employers. It matches job seekers with opportunities based on their skills, while also providing access to **free, localized courses** to help them upskill in high-demand sectors such as:

- **Technology**
- **Agriculture**
- **Business**

**Problem Statement:**
- 40% of Africa‚Äôs population aged over 15 is illiterate, and over 20% of Africans are unemployed.
- High unemployment rates persist across Africa, with a significant mismatch between the qualifications of job seekers and the needs of the job market.
- Limited access to quality education and training, especially in rural areas, further exacerbates the skills gap.

## Growth Prospects and Sectors

Africa‚Äôs growth potential spans multiple sectors. **JobConnect** focuses on these high-growth areas to maximize impact:

- **Technology & Innovation**: A booming sector with hubs in cities like Lagos, Nairobi, and Cape Town. Fintech innovations like M-Pesa in Kenya revolutionize financial services.
- **E-commerce**: Platforms like Jumia and Konga are transforming retail across Africa.
- **Agriculture**: Contributing 23% of Africa's GDP, employing over 60% of the population.
- **Banking**: African banks are expanding their offerings, providing products like credit cards and overdraft facilities.

Despite the continent‚Äôs growth prospects, challenges such as uncertain global economic conditions, growing debt payments, climate-related disasters, and escalating conflicts continue to pose risks.
